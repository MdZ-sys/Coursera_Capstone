                                                                  Capstone Project Report:

The query: 

Canada is one of the most popular countries in the world and the most popular city in it is not the capital Ottawa, but the city of Toronto.
Toronto has a population of 2.81 million with a size of 630.2 sq km , that is a population density of approx 4150 people per sq km.

Toronto does not have the best of weather conditions. The avg highest temperature recorded is about 27 degree celcius. The temperatures are generally around 15-20 degrees while ocassionaly hitting negetives of upto -7 degrees. 

Despite such conditions, Toronto is a prime destination for tourism and immigrants. I will attempt to decipher some of the reasons why using this project.

-----------------------

Basic description of the solution:

I will create a pandas dataframe using data collected from the internet to create a table of different neighborhoods in Toronto. Using this i will attempt to access foursquare api to get data related to my query.

Finally, i will come to a conclusion based on the data collected be me.
